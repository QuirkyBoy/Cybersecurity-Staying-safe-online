  <h1>Safety in numbers</h1>
  <p>When creating a password, the general gist is the more characters the better, but we begin to run into problems
    eventually, such as trying to remember it and not wanting to spend lots of time typing when you just want to browse
    your favorite website. Here are some things you can do to counter this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The most imprtant is to have a variety of different types of characters, such as letters, numbers, uppercase or
      lowercase or even things like !, # or @</li>
    <li>Another thing is to not follow regular patterns. Most people will do a word, normally their pet or something
      they're interested in with an uppercase for the first letter, then a number, often their year of birth. To make
      your password harder to guess, don't follow this format and make it more random.</li>
    <li>
      Make sure your password isn't easily traceable, such as your favourite pet or animal, or your best friend's name
      which can often be easily found on public social media accounts. Your birthday can also be easily found on these
      sites, so avoid using them.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you follow this advice, you should be able to create a strong password that is hard to guess, but easy to
    remember. If you want to increase security further, change your password around once a month, following the rules above.</p>
