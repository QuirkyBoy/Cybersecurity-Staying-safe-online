    <h1>Be careful what you wish for</h1>
    <p>You need to be extremely careful when posting things on social media because anyone anywhere can see it, and if people want to they will find ways of getting into private accounts as well, legally or not. On public accounts especially, big companies can gain loads of personal information as well as where you live and often your current location which they can use to target ads, send junk mail or worse.</p>
    <h2>How to protect yourself from social media</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Don't post personal information about you or other people, and don't have your details on your profile where anyone can see it
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't post anything you don't want to be seen, especially if you might regret it in the future
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid using puiblic chats / feeds and group chats with lots of people or people you don't know
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure your account details are secure to avoid getting hacked. You can read more information on this at <a href="passwords.html">passwords</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     In the end, whatever you post can be acessed by anyone, and it's your choice whether you post it or not.
